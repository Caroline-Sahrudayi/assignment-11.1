Q.3) How to show SQLite database table information in Android application what is the best way to do it?


Ans)
1)we can use Table Layout with cursor to display table in best way.
2) Showing database information will be better suited with table layout, since table layout is not an adapter view, so we can't use cursor adapter with it.
3) Table Layout is a layout that arranges its children into rows and columns. A Table Layout consists of a number of Table Row objects, each defining a row
4) Cursor is the Interface which represents a 2-dimensional table of any database. When you try to retrieve some data using SELECT statement, then the database will first create a CURSOR object and return its reference to you. In simple words, Cursor is a Interface which returns collection of your query data.
